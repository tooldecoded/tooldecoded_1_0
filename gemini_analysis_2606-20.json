  "reasoning": "The Milwaukee 2606-20 is a solid, entry-level M18 drill driver that offers good performance for general-purpose drilling and fastening tasks.  It's a reliable workhorse for both DIYers and light professional use.  While it's a brushed motor tool, which is less efficient and powerful than brushless alternatives, its 500 in-lbs of torque and 1800 RPM are sufficient for most common applications. Its build quality is typical of Milwaukee, meaning it's robust and designed to withstand jobsite abuse.  The ergonomics are comfortable for extended use.  Compared to other brushed M18 drill drivers (both current and older generations), its price point falls within a reasonable range, especially when found on sale.  Milwaukee often bundles older tool models into kits to move inventory, making proration a viable strategy.  The existence of brushless M18 drill drivers means this brushed model is positioned as a more budget-friendly option, and its pricing reflects this.\n\nStandalone pricing is based on its typical sale price.  Kit proration is estimated lower due to the fact that kits are often priced to move and the tool's value is diminished when bundled with batteries and chargers (which the user already possesses).  It serves as an excellent secondary drill or a starter tool for those already invested in the M18 platform.",
  "pros": [
    "Reliable Milwaukee brand reputation and support.",
    "Sufficient power (500 in-lbs torque, 1800 RPM) for most general drilling and fastening tasks.",
    "Durable build quality expected from Milwaukee.",
    "Comfortable ergonomics for extended use.",
    "Part of the vast and well-supported M18 battery ecosystem.",
    "Often available at competitive prices during sales or as part of bundled kits."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Brushed motor technology is less efficient, powerful, and durable than brushless alternatives.",
    "Lacks advanced features found on higher-end models (e.g., electronic clutch, multiple speed modes beyond two-speed gearbox).",
    "Not the most compact or lightweight drill available in the M18 line.",
    "Max torque of 500 in-lbs might be limiting for heavy-duty applications like large auger bits or driving long lag screws without pilot holes."
  ],
  "market_notes": "The 2606-20 is an older generation M18 drill driver. Milwaukee has since introduced numerous brushless M18 drill drivers (e.g., 2703-20, 2804-20, 2853-20) which offer significantly improved performance, efficiency, and features.  These brushless models typically retail for $150-$200+ as bare tools.  The 2606-20 is often found as a standalone bare tool for around $100-$130 during sales.  It's also frequently included in 'get the tool free' or heavily discounted kits where the primary value is in the batteries and charger.  When evaluating kit pricing, consider that the tool itself, being a brushed model, will be a smaller portion of the overall kit value compared to a brushless counterpart.  You can often find this tool in kits for $199-$299 which include two batteries and a charger.  Prorating its value in such a kit would place it in the $80-$120 range, depending on the kit's overall discount.  Keep an eye on clearance sections or holiday sales, as this model is often used to create attractive bundle deals."
